We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 0.15](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-digitalocean-spaces/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
      module "spaces" {
      source        = "terraform-do-modules/spaces/digitalocean"
      version       = "0.15.0"
      name          = "clouddrove"
      environment   = "test"
      label_order   = ["name"]
      acl           = "public-read"
      force_destroy = true
      region        = "nyc3"
    }
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| abort\_incomplete\_multipart\_upload\_days | Specifies the number of days after initiating a multipart upload when the multipart upload must be completed or else Spaces will abort the upload. | `number` | `null` | no |
| acl | Canned ACL applied on bucket creation (private or public-read). | `string` | `null` | no |
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`). | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| cors\_rule | CORS Configuration specification for this bucket | <pre>list(object({<br>    allowed_headers = list(string)<br>    allowed_methods = list(string)<br>    allowed_origins = list(string)<br>    expose_headers  = list(string)<br>    max_age_seconds = number<br>  }))</pre> | `null` | no |
| date | pecifies the date/time after which you want applicable objects to expire. The argument uses RFC3339 format, e.g.(2020-03-22T15:03:55Z) or parts thereof e.g. 2019-02-28. | `string` | `null` | no |
| delimiter | Delimiter to be used between `organization`, `environment`, `name` and `attributes`. | `string` | `"-"` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| expiration\_days | Specifies the number of days after object creation when the applicable objects will expire. | `number` | `null` | no |
| expired\_object\_delete\_marker | On a versioned bucket (versioning-enabled or versioning-suspended bucket), setting this to true directs Spaces to delete expired object delete markers. | `string` | `""` | no |
| force\_destroy | Unless true, the bucket will only be destroyed if empty (Defaults to false). | `bool` | `false` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| noncurrent\_version\_expiration | On a versioned bucket (versioning-enabled or versioning-suspended bucket), setting this to true directs Spaces to delete expired object delete markers. | `string` | `""` | no |
| prefix | (Optional, Forces new resource) Creates a unique bucket name beginning with the specified prefix. | `string` | `null` | no |
| region | The region to create VPC, like `london-1` , `bangalore-1` ,`newyork-3` `toronto-1`. | `string` | `""` | no |
| versioning | (Optional) A state of versioning (documented below). | `bool` | `true` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| bucket\_domain\_name | The date and time of when the VPC was created. |
| name | The date and time of when the VPC was created. |
| urn | The uniform resource name (URN) for the VPC. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
